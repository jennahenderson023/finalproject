	The University of Utah Sports Department Financial Tracker is a website that monitors the income and expenses of every sports team under the University of Utah sports department. The website provides a method of identifying various costs throughout the Athletic Department, ranging from coach salaries to athletic scholarships to equipment and event costs. This website is designed primarily for University of Utah administrators and board members, including Athletic Directors and University Executives, who need to compare the Athletic Department's annual incomes and expenses per team.
